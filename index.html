									<p>As Programming Chair in both <a href="https://thepipelineconference.com/event-schedule-2021/">2021</a> and <a href="https://thepipelineconference.com/event-schedule-2022/">2022</a>, I oversaw the team responsible for orchestrating the events that lay at the heart of the conference.<br /><br />
I worked with the board to figure out which event ideas were most popular, then directed the team in the tasks of fleshing them out, finding speakers, and expertly managing each step of an event's production down to tech-checks etc.<br /><br />The goal was to ensure speakers knew exactly what to expect and were prepared for their talks on the day-of,  which, not only would the audience enjoy listening to, but the speakers enjoyed giving.<br /><br />Since events were virtual I introduced the use of Slack as a 'green room' where speakers could check-in before their events and coordinate amongst themselves, and their event moderator. .</p>

									<p>
As Chair during Lockdown (<a href="https://lasiggraph.org/season/2021">2021</a> - <a href="https://lasiggraph.org/season/2022">2022</a>), my foremost objective was to sustain momentum by not missing a single month. Something many groups struggled with, often to find it arduous to reemerge, if at all, after Lockdown.<br /><br />I was responsible for organizing cutting-edge, timely, events such as <a href="https://lasiggraph.org/event/ai-vfx">AI in VFX</a>, and <a href="https://lasiggraph.org/event/robot-computer-graphics">Robot Computer Graphics</a>, drawing such large audiences, we decided to raise the chapter's Zoom limit. And when I did, <a href="https://lasiggraph.org/event/vfx-dune">The VFX of Dune</a>, our LinkedIn sign ups grew by over 10x.<br /><br />Dealing with companies such as Pixar, Warner, NVIDIA, and DNEG, was commonplace and I created informative, graphically stimulating, decks that quickly gave them the information they needed about the organization.</p>

									<h2 class="major"><a href="https://www.animaecaribe.com/">Animae Caribe</a></h2>
									<p>Facing an unexpected shift online during Lockdown, the animation festival hired me to create a fun day for it's closing. I crafted interesting experiences to compensate for the absence of in-person engagement using platorms such as Altspace for the closing event, attracting the most viewers on Altspace during it's time period.<br /><br /> A High Fidelity island map as a lounge attendees could roam between events, and Discord to host such events as a game tournament further enriched the experience,<br /><br />I art directed a talented team to create graphics tailored to each platform. And our innovative approach was noted in other islands of the Caribbean by events also trying to figure out ways to move their events online.</p>

										<h2 class="major">The SIGGRAPH Conference</h2>
										<p>I've done countless events for the conference, including those for others. My own events include the annual events: "<a href="http://s2016.siggraph.org/birds-feather/sessions/lets-talk-vr.html">Let's Talk VR</a>" (fa discussion on the future trajectory of the field), and "<a href="http://s2016.siggraph.org/birds-feather/sessions/getting-your-project-done-iv.html">Getting Your Project Done</a>" (discussing the pivotal roles of organization and project management to the final realization of a project).<br /><br />I also did, "<a href="https://s2021.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=div_107&sess=sess291">Let's Talk About Autism</a>" for the <a href="https://s2021.siggraph.org/event/diversity-summit/">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Summit</a>. And "<a href="https://s2023.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=bof_168&sess=sess468">AI and Art</a>", a sold-out discussion led by artists discussing the questions raised when using generative AI in the production of art.<br /><br />For all events I found speakers, worked with the conference to secure space etc., and managed all the many other tasks needed to bring them to fruition.

										<h2 class="major">Design</h2>
										<p>With over 15 years of design experience, I have a passion for bright colors and bold designs which stand out.<br /><br />Coming from the world of fine art I am a stickler for those meaningful little details that give a piece that extra depth, expecially when it comes to composition.
